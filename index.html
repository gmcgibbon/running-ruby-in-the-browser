            ## 👋 Hi, I'm Gannon

            ![Gannon](images/me.jpg)

            - Works at Shopify
            - Committer on Ruby on Rails
            - Organizes Winnipeg.rb
            Note:
            - Intro
            ---

            ## I love Ruby!

            ![Ruby](images/ruby-logo.png)

            Note:
            - I love Ruby
            - Not tired of it after 9 years
            - Syntax, APIs, community are wonderful
            ---
            ## I wish I could write it everywhere!

            # 🌎

            Note:
            - The problem is Ruby is server side only
            - I wish I could write it everywhere
            - Ruby just wasn't cut out to do that
            ---
            ## Ruby in the Browser

            ![Chrome](images/chrome-logo.png)

            Note:
            - For example, web browsers
            - They only understand HTML, CSS, JS
            - The front end doesn't understand Ruby, right?
            ---
            ## What about Try Ruby?

            ![TryRuby Website](images/tryruby.png)

            Note:
            - Many languages can be tested in the browser
            - Ruby is no different
            - Try Ruby lets you write Ruby and run it
            ---
            ## What about Try Ruby?

            # 🤔

            Note:
            - This should be impossible
            - How does it work?
            ---
            ## Idiomatically

            ```mermaid
            flowchart LR
              Client("👨‍💻")
              Language("💎")
              Server
              Client -- "puts 'hello'" --> Server
              Server -- "puts 'hello'" --> Language
              Language -- "hello" --> Server
              Server -- "{ result: 'hello' }" --> Client
            ```

            Note:
            - Idiomatically, this could work
            - Explain diagram
            - Some services do work like this
            ---
            ## Looking at the Source

            ![TryRuby Website Source](images/tryruby-source.png)

            Note:
            - Dig into the network inspector
            - We get something called ruby.wasm
            - Its a node package
            ---
            ## The NPM Package

            ![Ruby WASM Node Package](images/npm-package.png)

            Note:
            - If we head over to NPM we can see a few things
            - Its using head Ruby, which is brave
            - It is the "WebAssembly" port of CRuby
            ---
            ## WebAssembly (WASM)

            ![WebAssembly Logo](images/wasm-logo.png)

            Note:
            - What is WebAssembly?
            - WebAssembly isn't magic
            - It is a binary format from 2017
            - You can run binaries in a browser + elsewhere
            ---
            ## How do I use it?

            - Pick a language
            - Write some code
            - Compile it to WebAssembly!

            Note:
            - Use it by picking a language with wasm support
            - Writing code in that language
            - Compiling to a .wasm file
            - For interpreted languages like Ruby, not in that order
            ---
            ## How do I use it?

            ```wat
            ;; add.wat
            (module
              (func $add (param $lhs i32) (param $rhs i32) (result i32)
                local.get $lhs
                local.get $rhs
                i32.add)
              (export "add" (func $add))
            )
            ```

            Note:
            - For the sake of simplicity
            - Use language closest to the binary
            - This is WebAssembly text
            - Explain code
            ---
            ## How do I use it?

            ```sh
            brew install wabt
            ```
            ```sh
            wat2wasm add.wat
            ```
            Note:
            - WebAssembly binary toolkit converts wat to wasm
            - If we install the wabt package 
            - We can use wat2wasm to convert it to binary
            ---
            ## How do I run it?

            - Fetch the wasm file
            - "Instantiate" it
            - Call the exported function

            Note:
            - Might be wondering how to run it
            - In browser, you request it
            - Instantiate it in JavaScript
            - Call the export in JavaScript
            ---
            ## How do I run it?

            ```js
            const imports = {};

            fetch("add.wasm").then((wasmFile) => {
              return WebAssembly
                .instantiateStreaming(wasmFile, imports)
                .then((result) => result.instance.exports.add(1, 2));
            });
            ```
            Note:
            - Mention run button
            - Slides are in a browser
            - Explain code
            ---
            ## The NPM Package

            ![Ruby WASM Node Package](images/npm-package.png)

            Note:
            - Look again at NPM package
            - It also mentions WASI
            - What's that?
            ---
            ## WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)

            ![WASI Logo](images/wasi-logo.png)

            Note:
            - WebAssembly System Interface is an API spec for WASM
            - Been around since 2019
            - Many WASM-enabled languages use WASI
            - Ruby does too
            ---
            ## Why?

            ```mermaid
            flowchart TB
            subgraph WASM
              direction TB
              ruby("Ruby")
              wasi("WASI")
            end
            runtime("Runtime")
            ruby -- "follows" --> wasi
            WASM -- "plugs into" --> runtime
            ```

            Note:
            - The reason is a consistent interface
            - Explain diagram
            - Binary can plug into any WASI runtime
            ---
            ## Runtimes

            - Browser
            - Node.js
            - CLI tools (eg. wasmtime)

            Note:
            - WASI exposes defines contract
            - Anything that implements it can run it
            - Node, browsers, and CLI tools like wasmtime
            ---
            ## Let's run Ruby everywhere!

            # 🌎

            Note:
            - We know WASI and WASM now
            - Ruby WASM implements WASI
            - Let's run Ruby in these runtimes
            ---
            ## Browser

            ```html
            <script 
              src="https://unpkg.com/@ruby/3.3-wasm-wasi@2.6.2/dist/browser.script.iife.js"
              type="javascript">
            </script>
            <script type="text/ruby">
              puts "Hello WASM"
            </script>
            ```

            Note:
            - The browser is up first
            - A script that does it for you 
            - This is very common
            - Instantiating WebAssembly in hard
            ---
            ## Browser

            ```html
            <script 
              src="https://unpkg.com/@ruby/3.3-wasm-wasi@2.6.2/dist/browser.script.iife.js"
              type="javascript">
            </script>
            <script type="text/ruby">
              puts "Hello WASM"
            </script>
            ```

            Note:
            - WASI WebAssembly need a polyfill to work
            - Explain code
            ---
            ## Browser

            ```js
            rubyVM.eval(`
              require "stringio"

              io = StringIO.new("I ❤️ Ruby")

              io.read.reverse.chars
            `)
            ```

            Note:
            - We don't have to use Ruby script tag
            - When loaded, we have rubyVM global
            - It exposes eval to interpret Ruby
            - Explain code
            ---
            ## Browser

            ```js
            rubyVM.evalAsync(`
              require "js"

              body = JS.global[:document][:body]
              url = "https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"
              response = JS.global.fetch(url).await

              JS.global.alert("#{response.text.await}")
            `)
            ```

            Note:
            - The VM global also ships with a JS API
            - You can use it for JS interop
            - You can make network requests with evalAsync
            - Explain code
            ---
            ## Browser
            ```js
            rubyVM.eval(`
              require "yaml"
              
              module Converter
                def self.convert(obj)
                  obj.to_yaml
                end
              end
            `)
            const converter = rubyVM.eval(`Converter`)
            const convert   = function(obj) {
              const input = rubyVM.eval(JSON.stringify(obj))
              return converter.call(`convert`, input).toString()
            }
            convert({ a: { b: "c" } })
            ```

            Note:
            - We can also mix ruby into JS
            - Eval calls aren't isolated
            - Explain code
            ---
            ## Browser

            ```irb
            def say_hello(name)
              "Hello #{name}"
            end
            say_hello "WASM"
            ```

            Note:
            - Write a little JS, we can make our own Try Ruby
            - Demo it
            - Pretty cool, but not useful in prod
            ---
            ## Node

            ```sh
            npm install --save @ruby/3.3-wasm-wasi @ruby/wasm-wasi
            ```
            ```node
            // ruby.js

            import { readFile } from "fs/promises";
            import { DefaultRubyVM } from "@ruby/wasm-wasi/dist/node";

            const wasmFile = await readFile("./node_modules/@ruby/3.3-wasm-wasi/dist/ruby.wasm");
            const module = await WebAssembly.compile(wasmFile);
            const { vm } = await DefaultRubyVM(module);

            vm.eval(`puts "Hello WASM"`);
            ```

            Note:
            - Next up is Node
            - First install the ruby packages
            - Then we load it into in Node
            - Explain code
            ---
            ## Node

            ```sh
            node ruby.js
            ```
            ```sh
            Hello WASM
            ```

            Note:
            - You need a modern Node for this
            - Run script from terminal
            - Prints out what we expect
            - This is easier because node implements WASI
            ---
            ## Node

            ```node
            vm.evalAsync(`
              require "js"

              url = "https://webassembly.org/"
              
              puts JS.global[:process][:platform]
              puts JS.global.fetch(url).await.text.await
            `);
            ```
            ```text
            darwin
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html lang="en">
              ...
            </html>
            ```
            Note:
            - We can also use JS interop
            - Can access globals
            - Explain code
            ---
            ## CLI

            ```sh
            brew install wasmtime
            ```

            Note:
            - Finally, you can run wasm on your local machine
            - Strangely, easiest way to run wasm
            - Install a CLI runtime like wasmtime
            ---
            ## CLI

            ```sh
            curl -LO https://github.com/ruby/ruby.wasm/releases/latest/download/ruby.wasm
            ```
            ```sh
            wasmtime ruby.wasm -e "puts 'Hello WASM'"
            ```
            ```sh
            Hello WASM
            ```

            Note:
            - We need a special wasm binary
            - This one doesn't have JS bundled
            - Explain commands
            ---
            ## CLI

            ```sh
            wasmtime ruby.wasm hello.rb
            ```
            ```sh
            ruby.wasm: No such file or directory -- ./hello.rb (LoadError)
            ```
            ```sh
            wasmtime run --dir ./::/ ruby.wasm hello.rb
            ```
            ```sh
            Hello WASM
            ```

            Note:
            - The -e switch isn't practical
            - Worse, it can't find files you pass
            - Because wasm doesn't have direct access to disk
            - We could map it like this, but this is complicated
            ---
            ## CLI

            ![Ruvy](images/ruvy.png)

            Note:
            - Instead, we can use a different project
            - Ruvy by Shopify converts a script to wasm
            - Nice and easy
            ---
            ## CLI

            ```sh
            git clone https://github.com/Shopify/ruvy.git
            cd ruvy
            make
            cargo run --package=cli ./hello.rb
            ```

            Note:
            - To set up, clone
            - Run make
            - And then cargo to create index.wasm
            ---
            ## CLI

            ```sh
            wasmtime index.wasm
            ```
            ```sh
            Hello WASM
            ```

            Note:
            - Plug that into wasmtime
            - Much better
            - With effort, you can run this in browser
            - Or node, or any other WASI runtime
            ---
            ## What about gems?

            # 💎💎💎

            Note:
            - So great, we can run Ruby everywhere
            - Ruby isn't useful without gems
            - Can we bundle gems with our binary?
            ---
            ## Before you build

            - Minimal
            - Full
            - JS Interoperability

            Note:
            - Touched on this, supports multiple variations
            - Minimal binary has no standard gems
            - Full binary includes standard library
            - Binary may also have JS interop
            - Consider these options when building
            ---
            ## Building our own Ruby

            ```gemfile
            # Gemfile
            source "https://rubygems.org"

            gem "jwt"
            # gem "js" # if we want JS interop

            group :development do
              gem "ruby_wasm"
            end
            ```
            ```sh
            bundle install
            ```
            ```sh
            bundle exec rbwasm build -o ruby_with_jwt.wasm
            ```

            Note:
            - Building your own binary isn't hard
            - You need a Gemfile with ruby_wasm gem
            - Explain code
            ---
            ## Building our own Ruby

            ```sh
            INFO: Using Gemfile: [#<Pathname:/project/Gemfile>]
            ...
            INFO: Packaging gem: base64-0.2.0
            INFO: Packaging gem: jwt-2.8.1
            INFO: Packaging setup.rb: bundle/setup.rb
            INFO: Size: 51.28 MB

            ```rb
            # script.rb
            $LOAD_PATH << "/"

            require "bundle/setup"
            require "jwt"

            payload = { data: "test" }
            token = JWT.encode payload, nil, "none"

            puts token
            ```

            Note:
            - The build downloads and prints a lot
            - At the end, see the wasm bundle
            - Includes JWT gem, deps, and setup script
            - Explain code
            ---
            ## Building our own Ruby

            ```sh
            wasmtime run --dir ./::/ ruby_with_jwt.wasm script.rb
            ```
            ```sh
            Ignoring debug-1.9.1 because its extensions are not built. Try: gem pristine debug --version 1.9.1
            Ignoring racc-1.7.3 because its extensions are not built. Try: gem pristine racc --version 1.7.3
            Ignoring rbs-3.4.0 because its extensions are not built. Try: gem pristine rbs --version 3.4.0
            eyJhbGciOiJub25lIn0.eyJkYXRhIjoidGVzdCJ9
            ```

            Note:
            - Run it through wasmtime
            - Will output a web token
            - Along with a few warnings
            ---
            ## Limitations

            # 🚧

            Note:
            - A good time to talk about limitations
            - WASM is powerful, but new
            - And there are things it can't do yet
            ---
            ## Limitations

            ![Limitations](images/limitations.png)
            --

            Note:
            - From the Ruby.wasm readme
            - It can't do threading
            - It can't do network IO
            - We saw it can't use some gems
            - JS interop, to fill the gaps
            ---
            ## The Future

            ![Features](images/features.png)

            Note:
            - Limitations vary from language to language
            - Explain table
            - Note threading API on the way
            ---
            ## The Future

            ![Languages](images/languages.png)

            Note:
            - Explain list supported languages
            - Ruby is missing, so there's definitely more
            - Rust is probably the most feature-complete
            ---
            ## Why bother?

            - Speed
            - Security
            - Portability

            Note:
            - We know how to build WASM binaries
            - Why bother using it?
            - JS works fine, but there's three reasons for wasm
            ---
            ## Speed

            - Difficult to prove
            - It can be faster, but isn't always
            - Let's test this out!

            Note:
            - Can be difficult to prove
            - Faster for certain operations
            - Let's benchmark!
            ---
            ## Speed

            ```js
            const ips = (name, fn) => { 
              let times = 0
              const until = (new Date().getTime() / 1000) + 3;
              do {
                fn(); times++
              } while (new Date().getTime() / 1000 < until)
              return `${name}: ${times} in 3 seconds`
            }
            fetch("add.wasm").then((wasmFile) => {
              return WebAssembly
                .instantiateStreaming(wasmFile, {}).then((result) => {
                  const { add } = result.instance.exports
                  return ips("add wasm", () => add(1, 2)) +
                    ", " + ips("add js", () => 1 + 2)
                })
            })
            ```

            Note:
            - This is an iteration style benchmark
            - Records run count of a function runs in 3 seconds
            - Explain
            - Poll audience
            - Run it
            ---
            ## Speed

            # 🔎

            Note:
            - This is a micro-benchmark
            - We're too close to basics
            - We're not considering interop cost
            - Let's zoom out and benchmark bigger
            ---
            ## Speed

            ![WasmBoy Benchmark](images/wasmboy-benchmark.png)
            https://wasmboy.app/benchmark/

            Note:
            - WasmBoy is a GameBoy emulator written in WASM
            - WasmBoy has benchmark that compares WASM to JS impls
            - WASM kept a higher framerate overall
            ---
            ## Security

            - Executes in an isolated sandbox
            - By default, no filesystem
            - By default, no access to the DOM
            - By default, no access the the network

            Note:
            - Easier to prove
            - Execution isolated from the host machine
            - There's no fs by default
            - There's no dom access by default
            - No network by default
            ---
            ## Security

            # 🔒

            Note:
            - This is by design
            - Wouldn't be allowed in browsers otherwise
            - It can only do everything JS can
            ---
            ## Security
            ```sh
            wasmtime ruby.wasm hello.rb
            ```
            ```sh
            ruby.wasm: No such file or directory -- ./hello.rb (LoadError)
            ```
            ```sh
            wasmtime ruby_with_js.wasm
            ```
            ```sh
            Error: failed to run main module `ruby_with_js.wasm`

            Caused by:
                0: failed to instantiate "ruby_with_js.wasm"
                1: unknown import: `rb-js-abi-host::rb_wasm_throw_prohibit_rewind_exception` has not been defined
            ```

            Note:
            - Pretty useless by default
            - Nice that we can bridge the gap with JS where possible
            ---
            ## Portability

            - Run _any_ language in the browser
            - Run _any_ language in Node app
            - Run _any_ language locally via a binary

            Note:
            - Easiest to prove
            - Run Ruby in your browser, node app, or local machine
            - You don't need Ruby installed, its a binary
            - Write once, run everywhere
            ---
            ## Demo

            - [IRB](https://irb-wasm.vercel.app/)
            - [Mastodon (Chrome only)](https://mastodon-in-browser.vercel.app/boot.html)
            - [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com)
            - [Unity Web](https://petpumpkin.itch.io/handshakes)

            ---
            ## Summary

            - You can run Ruby _anywhere_ with WASM
            - You can build your own binaries
            - You might be using WASM more in the future

            Note:
            - You can run Ruby and many other languages anywhere
            - You can and should build purpose-built wasm binaries
            - There's a lot of potential in WASM, you might use it in the future
